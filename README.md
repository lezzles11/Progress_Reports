<table>
<tr>
<td>
Special Educators often need to generate hundreds of progress reports per progress reporting period (around once every three mounths) - however, this takes away from the important pieces of teaching: spending time teaching students. By streamlining this process, special educators may be better able to utilize their time in school, maximizing student potential.
